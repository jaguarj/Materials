# Materials Creative Co.

**Materials Creative Co.** is a company dedicated to finding really awesome
t-shirts that you'll actually want to wear! The idea came to be when I went
to a clothing store years ago never finding anything I would actually
want to wear. This lack of awesomeness lit a fire to start making my own
t-shirts while learning screen printing at home.

Thrifting was also another fun adventure, but that takes a lot of time
sifting through all the hand-me-downs at Goodwill, plus there is no guarentee
you'll actually find something.

Which led me to make a website where, my friends and I, could express what we
thought was cool and consumable.

**Materials Creative Co.** is a website where a user can view t-shirts, find
t-shirts, and have the ability to upload their own to demonstrate their
awesome t-shirt style.
